# Madde22
Madde22 Challenge : RESTful API

### node_modules Setup
- Make sure you install all node modules, both in server and client, before starting.

```
$ cd Madde22
$ cd server
$ npm install
$ cd ..
$ cd client
$ npm install
```

If you are running both on local, it should be fine.

If you are having troubles with installing npm, try removing node_module folder and package-lock.json and try installing again. 

```
$ rm -rf package-lock.json node_modules
```
